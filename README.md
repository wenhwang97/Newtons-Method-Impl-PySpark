# Newton Raphson Method Implemented in PySpark
## Introduction
<p>
This repository is mainly for study purposes. It contains the Python implementation of the algorithm using PySpark. It is a simple version of implementation of the Newton's Method algorithm. It also includes a very basic version of Stochastic Gradient Descent without regularization for comparison.
